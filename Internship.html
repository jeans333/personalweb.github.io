            <h2>Defining a new business management system</h2>
            <p>I collaborated with developers to implement a new business management system: focusing on customer and data management, by developing a new, user-friendly solution for financial advisors and other employees. I conducted user research, created user flows, wireframed, and prototyped the system while collaborating closely with developers and conducting usability testing. Our small team size allowed me to work directly with the product manager and engineers to effectively present our progress to stakeholders and ensure a seamless transition to the new system.</p>

            <h2>Why do we need a change?</h2>
            <p>At the start of my internship, there was no separate system to manage customers information for financial advisors and administrative employees. Using a spreadsheet to track and manage customer information was not efficient and prone to error. To help save time on maintaining the business information, my team began designing</p>

        <h2>Primary Research</h2>
        <div class="sentence"><p>It was important to understand the users which meant the employees at the company. I was able to conduct 6 user interviews among the financial advisors and administrative assistants who would be using the system frequently.  These are a few of the questions i asked to get an idea of their responsibilities and interactions with their system to understand their role as a user.</p>

            <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Please describe your typical process of accessing the system and how you use it on a day to day basisÂ </li>
                <li>How often do you search or view a customer information and how often for adding new ones</li>
                <li>What information would you like to see first that you search for the most</li>

        <div class="sentence"><p>I then organized the pain points and goals from the responses to brainstorm solutions from key takeaways</p></div>

                <h3>Fear of missing out</h3>
                <p>Users struggle with focusing on either school or social life without feeling guilty about how they are spending time. Students from other campuses feel more isolated or less connected with peers </p>

                <h3>Going back to old ways</h3>
                <p>Time management applications with various customization features can be overwhelming for users to set up and get adjusted to, often causing them to give up after a short period of time</p>
            </div>
            <div class="findings-card2">
                <h3>Neglect of self care</h3>
                <p>When interviewing students, most said self care was not even on the list of priorities during school terms. Does self care and work only be mutually exclusive?</p>

        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <p>We continued with user flows to visualize paths and key features including</p>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>During my internship, i also had to create a design system for the companys future website designs, which was then used for the style guide of this project</p>

        <h2>Wireframing</h2>
        <p>Next, I followed the style guide and created a low fidelity prototype on Figma for testing</p>

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>I then had the opportunity to directly recieve feedback for iterations through usability testing with the financial advisors who would be utilizing the final prototype. Getting their perspective was extremely helpful in identifying edge cases and meeting user goals.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>The internship was one of my most valuable experiences as I got to work closely with the developers of the project, getting to see various sides of the development process. Before going into this, I hadn't realized the importance of compromising and communication required to meet requirements of a project from both ends, to maintain the practicality and aesthetics of the interfaces. Getting the opportunity to receive direct feedback from user testing and getting to hear their perspective helped me grow as a designer. I was able to integrate their feedback to continue various iterations and continuously improve my design approaches.</p>
